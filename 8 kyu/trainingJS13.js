/*
Coding in function whatNumberIsIt. function accept 1 parameter:n. it's a number.

To judge the number n. If n is one of the above five constants, return one of these string:

"Input number is Number.MAX_VALUE"
"Input number is Number.MIN_VALUE"
"Input number is Number.NaN"
"Input number is Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY"
"Input number is Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY"

Other values should return "Input number is xxx". xxx means this number.

For example:

whatNumberIsIt(1/0) should return "Input number is Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY"
whatNumberIsIt(100) should return "Input number is 100"

What you need to think about is how to judge it correctly and effectively and don't forget isNaN().

//Answer

function whatNumberIsIt(n){
    return `Input number is ${Number.isNaN(n) ? `Number.NaN` : 
      n === Number.MAX_VALUE ? `Number.MAX_VALUE` :
        n === Number.MIN_VALUE ? `Number.MIN_VALUE` :
          n === Infinity ? `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` :
            n === -Infinity ? `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` : n}`;
  }
