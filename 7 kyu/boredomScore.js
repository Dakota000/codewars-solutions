/*
You will be provided with an object(staff) containing the staff names as keys, and the department they work in as values.

Each department has a different boredom assessment score, as follows:

accounts = 1
finance = 2
canteen = 10
regulation = 3
trading = 6
change = 6
IS = 8
retail = 5
cleaning = 4
pissing about = 25

Depending on the cumulative score of the team, return the appropriate sentiment:

<=80: 'kill me now'
< 100 & > 80: 'i can handle this'
100 or over: 'party time!!'
*/

//Answer

function boredom(staff) {
  const departmentScores = {
    accounts: 1,
    finance: 2,
    canteen: 10,
    regulation: 3,
    trading: 6,
    change: 6,
    IS: 8,
    retail: 5,
    cleaning: 4,
    'pissing about': 25
  };

  let totalBoredomScore = Object.values(staff).reduce((total, department) => {
    return total + departmentScores[department];
  }, 0);

  return totalBoredomScore <= 80 ? 'kill me now'
       : totalBoredomScore < 100 ? 'i can handle this'
       : 'party time!!';
}
