/*
Given an array of integers of any length, return an array that has 1 added to the value represented by the array.
    the array can't be empty
    only non-negative, single digit integers are allowed

Return nil (or your language's equivalent) for invalid inputs.

Examples:

Valid arrays
[4, 3, 2, 5] would return [4, 3, 2, 6]
[1, 2, 3, 9] would return [1, 2, 4, 0]
[9, 9, 9, 9] would return [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 3, 7] would return [0, 1, 3, 8]

Invalid arrays
[1, -9] is invalid because -9 is not a non-negative integer
[1, 2, 33] is invalid because 33 is not a single-digit integer

function upArray(arr) {

    if(arr[i] < 9){
      arr[i]++
      return arr
    }
    arr[i] = 0
  }
  
  return [1, ...arr]
