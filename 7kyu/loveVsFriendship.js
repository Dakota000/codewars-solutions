/*
Ifã€€a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ... z = 26

Then l + o + v + e = 54

and f + r + i + e + n + d + s + h + i + p = 108

So friendship is twice as strong as love :-)

Your task is to write a function which calculates the value of a word based off the sum of the alphabet positions of its characters.

The input will always be made of only lowercase letters and will never be empty.

function wordsToMarks(string){
  let abc = ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j','k','l','m','n','o','p','q','r','s','t','u','v','w','x','y','z']
  return string.split('').map(letter => abc.indexOf(letter) + 1).reduce((acc, c) => acc + c,0)
